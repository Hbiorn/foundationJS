const planet = "Earth";
let author = "current user";
//solution//
let ourPlanetName = "Earth";
//Note, we could use a shorter name planet, but it might not be obvious what planet it refers to. It’s nice to be more verbose. At least until the variable isNotTooLong.//
let currentUserName = "John";
//Again, we could shorten that to userName if we know for sure that the user is current. Modern editors and autocomplete make long variable names easy to write. Don’t save on them. A name with 3 words in it is fine.//

console.log("hello")
